# FeatherLogger_Android

This repository contains the important files pertaining to an Android app designed to retrieve data from an Arduino logging unit over Bluetooth LE. This is part of a larger project, including the code for the logging unit as well as a companion iOS app. The code for those aspects can be found in separate repositories under my account.

More about this project and others can be found on my personal website: http://lilleypad.net.
